  <h1>MEET THE CHARACTERS OF LOVE AND DEEP SPACE</h1>
  <p class="intro">Your mission through the vastness of space is guided by more than just dutyâ€”it's shaped by the people you meet along the way. Each of these characters brings unique strengths, hidden vulnerabilities, and the potential for deep connections.</p>

  <div class="character-container">
    <div class="character">
      <img src="Xavier.png" alt="Xavier">
      <div class="character-info">
        <h2>Xavier</h2>
        <p class="character-title">Deep Space Huntsman / Prince of Philos</p>
        <p>A calm and composed heir to the throne, Xavier is both emotionally stable and patient, with a strong desire for freedom and equality. Despite his royal status, he prefers a low-key, simple life. He has a compassionate nature but can be intensely possessive in romantic relationships, revealing a side that craves control. His pursuit of truth and fairness drives his mission but also shapes his relationships.</p>

      <div class="character-info">
        <h2>Zayne</h2>
        <p class="character-title">Cardiac Surgeon / Eternal Prophet</p>
        <p>Zayne exudes an aura of distance, giving off the impression of being unreachable. Mature, stable, and responsible, he tends to approach situations with seriousness and rationality, rarely letting emotions drive his decisions. He speaks frankly and has an unusual imagination, often slipping in bad jokes with a straight face. His exterior is cold and detached, but underneath, he harbors a restrained yet eager affection. His real emotional depth becomes more apparent to those who break through his aloof facade.</p>

    <div class="character">
      <img src="Rafayel.png" alt="Rafayel">
      <div class="character-info">
        <h2>Rafayel</h2>
        <p class="character-title">Artist / God of Lemurian</p>
        <p>Rafayel is pure and endearing, with emotions that run deep and unguarded. He's highly attuned to others' feelings, always putting their needs before his own. Though a little proud and quick to blush, he's sensitive, anxious, and takes his responsibilities seriously, guided by a strong sense of justice. Around those he cares about, Rafayel is lively and talkative, showing a pure, almost childlike affection and dependence, like a small, loyal animal. To outsiders, he's distant, avoiding noisy places and disliking unnecessary physical contact. Rafayel is deeply introspective, valuing his inner world and fiercely pursuing freedom without being tied down.</p>

      <div class="character-info">
        <h2>Sylus</h2>
        <p class="character-title">Head of District N109 / Dragon</p>
        <p>Sylus is a blend of caution and gentleness, always straightforward and sincere. Beneath his calm exterior lies an untamed, wild spirit that refuses to be restrained. He's fearless and rebellious, yet deeply considerate and sensitive to those around him. His steady, composed nature reflects the wisdom gained from time and experience. Sylus thrives in solitude, naturally watchful and reserved. His actions aren't driven by a desire to defy norms but are the result of careful observations of human nature, allowing him to navigate the world with sharp insight and quiet strength.</p>

    <div class="character">
      <img src="Caleb.png" alt="Caleb">
      <div class="character-info">
        <h2>Caleb</h2>
        <p class="character-title">DAA Fighter Pilot / Fleet Marshal</p>
        <p>Caleb embodies a complex blend of tenderness and strength, protection and control, sunshine and forbearance. He is gentle, warm, and deeply protective, striving to shield the player while encouraging their growth and freedom. Though strong-willed on matters of principle, he prioritizes the player's happiness, often indulging their needs without causing harm. Caleb and the player were adopted together and shared a brother-sister relationship with no blood relation. His personality reveals both the authority of a protector and the vulnerability of someone emotionally dependent, making him a comforting presence yet occasionally overwhelming. His feelings for the player go beyond a simple sibling bond, carrying a mix of deeper emotions, fears of losing connection, and emotional insecurity that adds layers to his character.</p>
